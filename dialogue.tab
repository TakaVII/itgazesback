tunnels_logan_cbabd83b		An unknown amout of time passes before Quinn manages to wake up	game/level1.rpy	27	"[what]"

tunnels_logan_21d56b27		Quinn grabs his head, as he has a splitting headache that threatens to turn the content of his stomach the opposite way.	game/level1.rpy	34	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_65384040	q	What... eh? A note?	game/level1.rpy	36	q "[what]"

tunnels_logan_6033a62b		He reads it for a while but fails to make sense of it immediately	game/level1.rpy	43	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_e7aacdb3	q	But, what does this all mean? 'Use the shafts'? 'don't be seen'? 'red'-wait	game/level1.rpy	45	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_dc8c5ccd	q	That thing... I remember	game/level1.rpy	55	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_e0030e23		He glances around, and recognizes that he is not inside a room or the medical bay...	game/level1.rpy	57	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_05be4400		He is inside a ventilation shaft.	game/level1.rpy	59	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_d49d42ee		The ventilation shaft was a narrow, dark, and compressed passageway that wound its way through the heart of the spaceship.	game/level1.rpy	61	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_38022ef0		It was barely large enough for a human to squat through, and the only light came from the faint glow of the emergency lights that were scattered at intervals along the walls.	game/level1.rpy	63	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_ab8ed2f5	q	Just what the hell happened here?	game/level1.rpy	65	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_6afd1ed8		Had he not experienced the red eye's glance before, he would not have believed any of this to be anything but a joke, a prank played to him by some of the crew	game/level1.rpy	67	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_25f60900		But he felt it in his guts, there was something else going on here	game/level1.rpy	69	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_3b90e6e4	q	Alright, let's just do as he said, keep to the shafts... fuck	game/level1.rpy	71	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_0ef02a4d		There was one problem with that...Quinn had a problem with enclosed spaces, especifically, he suffered from claustrophobia.	game/level1.rpy	73	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_d1bb0a4e	q	Well, this had to happened sooner or later, facing your fears... I should have gone to therapy sooner	game/level1.rpy	75	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_19de1921	q	Forget about it, let's see, the shafts are not connected to each other, they connect areas to other areas but they are not connected to each other, so I have to use the shaft to go to a room, and then enter the next shaft there	game/level1.rpy	77	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_e4e7d97e	q	Why did they really have to design this freaking ship like this...I have no idea where I am right now, so I guess I have to go to the next room and see, find out how far I am from the docks	game/level1.rpy	79	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_0770f8cb	q	Alright Quinn, you've got this... you've got this	game/level1.rpy	81	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_0d2ba8c9		The air in the shaft felt thick and heavy, as if he was walking through a swamp, and it was difficult to breathe. The metal walls grated against Quinn's skin as he had to advance some parts squatting, some parts crawling through the narrow space.	game/level1.rpy	86	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_122f05da		Quinn's heart pounded in his chest, and breaths came in shallow gasps.	game/level1.rpy	88	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_67be2b54		He had to swallow his own panic to be able to continue forward. And he did, until he finally found the end of this particular shaft. The shafts had the particularity of being easy to enter, as a ship so crowded like this one needed a way for emergency staff to move through rooms without having to navigate crowds of people.	game/level1.rpy	90	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_11e97237		At the end of the shaft, a small door, barely enough to crawl out of, was a beacon of misguided hope for Quinn, who at this point only wished to be out of this horrible situation.	game/level1.rpy	92	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_cf7e9488		But then, the smell, it hit him... A ventilation shaft does, well, ventilate, and the many smells of each room go through it until they are extinguished by the next room's smell. But this smell, it was not a smell that should be found here, it was metallic and acrid, leaving a foul taste in one's mouth.	game/level1.rpy	94	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_23f3b8fb		It smelled of blood.	game/level1.rpy	96	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_d267661a	q	...	game/level1.rpy	103	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_36d1c910		Quinn's heart skipped a beat, and he felt his stomach turn. He had to swallow his own vomit, and he felt his eyes water.	game/level1.rpy	105	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_532911da		He recognized this pathway, this is one of the main corridors of the ship, connected on one side to the dining hall, and another to one of the living quarters.	game/level1.rpy	107	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_a59ae3b5		The once dark silver metallic pathway is now a sickly red, splattered with blood and gore, painting a macabre scene that sends shivers down the spine.	game/level1.rpy	109	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_08ca576f		The walls are adorned with dark streaks and handprints, radiating the desperation of the ones that were here before.	game/level1.rpy	111	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_a7b5a9ef		This... this was a massacre, a slaughter, a bloodbath. What the hell happened here?!	game/level1.rpy	113	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_364330d4		As Quinn turns back as fast as he can, he can no longer hold his puke, and let's it all out inside the shaft, now filled with the combinated smells of blood and vomit.	game/level1.rpy	123	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_25c4a879	q	...I-I can't...	game/level1.rpy	127	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_9125da5d		His breathing was ragged, he felt like he was about to pass out, but the memory of what happened before came to him. Who knew how things would look if he were to pass out again? He had to move, quickly.	game/level1.rpy	129	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_6f87f1e4		He focused as much as possible on his survival, trying to forget about the smells and how it felt like the walls of the shaft moved and closed in on him. He moved forward...	game/level1.rpy	131	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_62f21c95		Only to find himself face to face with debris blocking the other side of the shaft.	game/level1.rpy	133	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_2e8e6686		He felt his heart skip a beat, and his mind struggling to accept this.	game/level1.rpy	135	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_6e8ec6ca	q	The note...	game/level1.rpy	137	q "[what]"
tunnels_logan_9ecbd18b		Yeah, the note he found on himselft when he woke up, perhaps it had been Logan that blocked this exit when he left him there.	game/level1.rpy	139	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_a51d209d		If so, then going back would not be any better, which made Quinn think how could the sight of that corridor be the better choice between the two.	game/level1.rpy	141	"[what]"
tunnels_logan_908545bd		He didn't want to find out. As hard as it was to go through this again, he returned to the entrance of the corridor, and went in.	game/level1.rpy	143	"[what]"
corridor1_35cee7a6		The floor, normally a sturdy structure, now sinks beneath Quinn's feet, slick with a combination of blood and bodily fluids.	game/level1.rpy	156	"[what]"
corridor1_649eb18c		He feels his stomach turn when he takes a step forward and feels something squishy get crushed by his foot, and he has to swallow his own vomit again.	game/level1.rpy	158	"[what]"
corridor1_82d06f94	q	Oh God...	game/level1.rpy	162	q "[what]"
corridor1_bd783de6		He had to move, get to the next shaft and keep moving like that until he reached the docks.	game/level1.rpy	164	"[what]"
corridor1_0a609d0f		The entrance to the next shaft was luckily very close, just a couple dozen steps away from him. As he was finally out of the ventilation system, he could at least move around with more freedom.	game/level1.rpy	166	"[what]"
corridor1_287da77f		Quinn took careful steps, trying to be as stealthy as possible, even though there was no one close, no one alive at least.	game/level1.rpy	168	"[what]"
corridor1_246f43bd		In a moment, he was already in front of the next shaft.	game/level1.rpy	170	"[what]"
corridor1_b112fb79		He went to open it, as he could do so by just flipping a couple of switches near it and pressing a confirmation button.	game/level1.rpy	172	"[what]"
corridor1_2aecea42		When we was about to press the button, the last step to open the shaft, he heard a noice behind him.	game/level1.rpy	174	"[what]"
corridor1_a2cbfdab		It was still far away, probably even on the previous room, but he was sure he heard something moving.	game/level1.rpy	176	"[what]"
corridor1_0168edd5		Quinn reacted by inertia, without really thinking, forgetting for a moment the contents of the letter.	game/level1.rpy	182	"[what]"
corridor1_024837ea		At first, there was nothing, but then, a familiar face popped up from the end of the corridor.	game/level1.rpy	184	"[what]"
corridor1_69171e1c		It was Alan, but there was something... unnerving about him.	game/level1.rpy	188	"[what]"
corridor1_cfdba7db		He was covered from head to toe in blood stains, some looked dry and some fresh.	game/level1.rpy	190	"[what]"
corridor1_6eda0211		And he was looking straight at Quinn, with the most crazed smile he had ever seen.	game/level1.rpy	192	"[what]"
corridor1_3ef6932c	q	Alan?...	game/level1.rpy	194	q "[what]"
corridor1_4a6a3b9a		Quinn muttered the name, but he refrained from calling out to him. But it was of no use, Alan immediately started sprinting towards Quinn.	game/level1.rpy	196	"[what]"
corridor1_ab12ad60		Quinn felt his heart skip a beat, and rushed to open the shaft.	game/level1.rpy	198	"[what]"
corridor1_05519720		He managed to get it open but Alan got to him before he could get down to enter	game/level1.rpy	200	"[what]"
corridor1_7e84c1f4		Quinn felt something piercing his shoulder, and he felt his body go numb. He looked at his shoulder, and saw a knife sticking out of it.	game/level1.rpy	205	"[what]"
corridor1_7c800bc4		He pushed Alan back, and empowered by pure adrenaline, managed to even make him tumble to the ground. Quinn used this moment to get inside the shaft and close it behind him.	game/level1.rpy	207	"[what]"
corridor1_a7e04d21		He started crawling as fast as possible to get away from him, but he noticed after a few seconds that Alan was not pursuing him.	game/level1.rpy	209	"[what]"
corridor1_a80577e2		Why was that, he did not understand, but he was grateful of it. 	game/level1.rpy	211	"[what]"
corridor1_cddb28fc		He had been stabbed in the shoulder, and the knife was still there. Quinn knew he had to remove it if he wanted to survive. The thought of being trapped in the shaft, covered in his own blood, was too much to bear. 	game/level1.rpy	213	"[what]"
corridor1_c436c95d		He was still having a hard time taking all in and know he had been stabbed! And he wasn't even allowed the time to process all of this. He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. He told himself that he had to be strong, that he had to survive.	game/level1.rpy	215	"[what]"
corridor1_b011f47d		He carefully reached up with his other hand and felt for the knife. He could feel the warm, sticky blood on his fingers. Taking another deep breath, Quinn gripped the handle of the knife and pulled it out in a swift motion.	game/level1.rpy	217	"[what]"
corridor1_4045dde2		The blood spurted out of the wound, and he felt himself getting dizzy. The pain was immense, making him drop the knife into a deep crevice.	game/level1.rpy	219	"[what]"
corridor1_e70c0e09		Perhaps due to his own deteriorating state of mind, he managed to put the pain behind and continue through the shaft.	game/level1.rpy	223	"[what]"
corridor1_bdeb59d6		But the mental pressure that came from the fact that he knew that Alan was still behind the other side of the shaft put enough pressure into Quinn that he soldiered through and advanced down the shaft.	game/level1.rpy	229	"[what]"
corridor1_9b07251e		Quinn pressed the button, and the door opened with a click.	game/level1.rpy	235	"[what]"
corridor1_ab1f4de7		He had to get on his knees to get in and he did so as fast as he could possibly manage	game/level1.rpy	237	"[what]"
corridor1_60788112		Quinn felt the need to look back, the curiosity getting the better of him, and how to blame him? He had just seen a scene straight out of the most terrible nightmares one could have, and still had no idea of exactly what was going on.	game/level1.rpy	247	"[what]"
corridor1_e09e651b		He soon regretted his decision.	game/level1.rpy	249	"[what]"
corridor1_3ef6932c_1	q	Alan?...	game/level1.rpy	253	q "[what]"
corridor1_5bf35d4d		Quinn muttered the name, but he refrained from calling out to him.	game/level1.rpy	255	"[what]"
corridor1_18b01079		Alan looked haggard, with blood all over his body, but one could tell, even from a distance, that there was a crazed smile on his face, as if he was having the time of his life.	game/level1.rpy	257	"[what]"
corridor1_7a2b5675		He was holding a knife, and was looking at the entrance of the shaft, as if he was waiting for someone to come out of it.	game/level1.rpy	259	"[what]"
corridor1_4fbdb2c7		Quinn felt his heart skip a beat, and his mind struggling to take this all in.	game/level1.rpy	265	"[what]"
corridor1_56c99b81		He had to move, quickly.	game/level1.rpy	267	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_cbabd83b		An unknown amout of time passes before Quinn manages to wake up	game/level1.rpy	278	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_d0e4d442	q	Ugh...my head	game/level1.rpy	283	q "[what]"
tunnels_yselle_21d56b27		Quinn grabs his head, as he has a splitting headache that threatens to turn the content of his stomach the opposite way.	game/level1.rpy	285	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_65384040	q	What... eh? A note?	game/level1.rpy	287	q "[what]"
tunnels_yselle_b35f3064		He grabs the note with his hand, and recognizes Yselle's handwriting from this. He sees that same handrwiting in all of his performance reviews.	game/level1.rpy	292	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_6033a62b		He reads it for a while but fails to make sense of it immediately	game/level1.rpy	294	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_95a2aa40	q	But, what does this all mean? 'Keep to the shafts'? 'don't be seen'? 'red'-wait	game/level1.rpy	296	q "[what]"

tunnels_yselle_25f60900		But he felt it in his guts, there was something else going on here	game/level1.rpy	320	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_2d0aadb4	q	Alright, let's just do as she said, keep to the shafts... fuck	game/level1.rpy	322	q "[what]"

tunnels_yselle_0770f8cb	q	Alright Quinn, you've got this... you've got this	game/level1.rpy	332	q "[what]"
tunnels_yselle_0d2ba8c9		The air in the shaft felt thick and heavy, as if he was walking through a swamp, and it was difficult to breathe. The metal walls grated against Quinn's skin as he had to advance some parts squatting, some parts crawling through the narrow space.	game/level1.rpy	337	"[what]"

tunnels_yselle_36d1c910		Quinn's heart skipped a beat, and he felt his stomach turn. He had to swallow his own vomit, and he felt his eyes water.	game/level1.rpy	355	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_6bede0c8		This was the dining hall of the ship.	game/level1.rpy	357	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_4b4f011f		The dining hall was a scene of carnage. The floor was slick with blood, and blood stains splattered the walls and tables. Some of the chairs were overturned, as if diners had fled in terror. Others remained upright, empty and silent.	game/level1.rpy	359	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_566aa26d		The air was thick with the smell of blood and rot. It was a smell that made one's stomach churn and skin crawl.	game/level1.rpy	361	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_d4a61f70		There were no bodies in sight, but it was clear that someone or something had been killed in this room. The blood was still fresh, and there were pools of it on the floor that had not yet had time to congeal.	game/level1.rpy	363	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_07f562d5		A few of the tables were still set, with plates, silverware, and glasses arranged neatly. But the food that had been served on them was long gone, and the plates were now covered in a thick layer of blood.	game/level1.rpy	365	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_a7b5a9ef		This... this was a massacre, a slaughter, a bloodbath. What the hell happened here?!	game/level1.rpy	367	"[what]"

tunnels_yselle_4a80b189		Only to find that on the other side of the shaft, there were people moving around. He could hear the footsteps and the murmurs, and he used the fact that the door of the shaft could allow him to take a peek.	game/level1.rpy	387	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_5e050e83		He soon regretted that.	game/level1.rpy	389	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_0dbb681f		A group of crewmembers were walking towards the direction of the cargobay. But every single one of them had a strange look in their eyes, without focus, like they were mindless husks.	game/level1.rpy	393	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_070135e9		Their faces were all full of lacerations, and the accumulated blood from all of them was starting to turn the floor of the corridor red.	game/level1.rpy	395	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_c6efb993		They did not seem to mind their own wounds, even as some of them looked like they could be fatal.	game/level1.rpy	397	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_2e8e6686		He felt his heart skip a beat, and his mind struggling to accept this.	game/level1.rpy	399	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_6e8ec6ca	q	The note...	game/level1.rpy	401	q "[what]"
tunnels_yselle_cecb437b		Yeah, the note he found on himselft when he woke up, perhaps that's what Yselle meant by keeping to the shafts and don't let them see you	game/level1.rpy	403	"[what]"
tunnels_yselle_3f39ed93		If so, then going back would not be any better, which made Quinn think how could the sight of that dining hall be the better choice between the two.	game/level1.rpy	405	"[what]"

b_dining_hall_c2da75b9		The floor was so full of blood and fat that if Quinn didn't actively balance himself, he would fall headfirst into the gore.	game/level1.rpy	420	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_da88b57a		He has to swallow his own vomit when he sees what appears to be guts tangled in one of the chairs.	game/level1.rpy	422	"[what]"

b_dining_hall_bd783de6		He had to move, get to the next shaft and keep moving like that until he reached the docks.	game/level1.rpy	428	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_5692ef1b		The entrance to the next shaft was near, close to the entrance to the kitchen area of the hall. As he was finally out of the ventilation system, he could at least move around with more freedom.	game/level1.rpy	430	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_287da77f		Quinn took careful steps, trying to be as stealthy as possible, even though there was no one close, no one alive at least.	game/level1.rpy	434	"[what]"

b_dining_hall_be2174b1		At first, there was nothing to be seen, but when he heard a noise again coming from the ground, he saw something that made his brain feel a shock.	game/level1.rpy	450	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_82cbee77		It was a ball of flesh, with two eyes that looked straight at Quinn.	game/level1.rpy	455	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_76c5ad12		He felt an instinctive horror at that creature, like this was not something that should exist.	game/level1.rpy	457	"[what]"

b_dining_hall_ba8859c3	q	What?	game/level1.rpy	461	q "[what]"
b_dining_hall_de849220		Quinn heard a voice that took him out of the trance he entered when looking at the creature. When he looked up, he saw Mr. Han, one of the senior welders in the ship, standing above the creature with a leg up.	game/level1.rpy	463	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_4cdbb9f7	han	...	game/level1.rpy	467	han "[what]"
b_dining_hall_ef1a1609		With a powerful stomp, Mr. Han crushed the creature instantly, scateering blood all around as if it had been made purely out of gore.	game/level1.rpy	471	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_f4087f4d	han	You have to run now boy	game/level1.rpy	476	han "[what]"

b_dining_hall_bf0fb6d9	han	They are coming boy! Just run! Go in there!	game/level1.rpy	482	han "[what]"
b_dining_hall_13711837		Quinn didn't lose the opportunity and open the shaft and went inside, leaving it open so that Mr. Han could get to safety as well.	game/level1.rpy	484	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_294c1ed4		But the shaft's door closed violently, Quinn hearing the clicking sound it made when it got closed for good.	game/level1.rpy	486	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_8a025009		He hurried to reopen it from the inside but he heard Mr. Han's voice again.	game/level1.rpy	488	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_627dda3d	han	Get to the docks, we'll meet there.	game/level1.rpy	490	han "[what]"
b_dining_hall_5e232491		After he said that, a screeching sound was heard.	game/level1.rpy	492	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_61c322f5	han	Go now, run!	game/level1.rpy	494	han "[what]"
b_dining_hall_be21c20a		Quinn was partially reluctant to leave his savior there, but his survival instinct kicked in, and he heeded the words of Mr. Han, rushing forward into the shaft.	game/level1.rpy	496	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_9b07251e		Quinn pressed the button, and the door opened with a click.	game/level1.rpy	502	"[what]"
b_dining_hall_de5e8260		He had to get on his knees to get in and he did so as fast as he could possibly manage.	game/level1.rpy	504	"[what]"
corridor3_ccad3edf		He knew that he had to keep moving, but the claustrophobia was getting to him. He felt like the walls were closing in on him, and he couldn't breathe.	game/level2.rpy	31	"[what]"
corridor3_08a9f77a		This shaft had even less space than the one before, he had to crawl through most of it. And because this one went down, he had to crawl downwards, which was even more uncomfortable.	game/level2.rpy	33	"[what]"
corridor3_0b31aa31		Also, as this shaft went below the floor of the room above, there was blood leaking out from the crevices in the ceiling.	game/level2.rpy	35	"[what]"
corridor3_c124c3de		Quinn crawled slowly through the shaft, his heart pounding in his chest. He could feel the blood dripping onto his skin, and the smell of it was making him gag.	game/level2.rpy	37	"[what]"

corridor3_d10c1e20		He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He focused on his breathing and tried to relax. Even though he could not manage to calm himself, he could at least breathe again.	game/level2.rpy	57	"[what]"
corridor3_79d28132		After managing to get his breathing under control, Quinn resumed his journey through the narrow ventilation shaft, until he finally reached the exit, and took a glance from the slits in the door.	game/level2.rpy	59	"[what]"
cameraroom_fa153d51		Quinn took a glance from the slits in the door, and found that this room looked particularly untouched, there is no one to be seen.	game/level2.rpy	67	"[what]"
cameraroom_890e7960	q	Finally, an open space to breathe...	game/level2.rpy	71	q "[what]"
cameraroom_28bfc0ff		He steps out of the shaft with confidence, and looks around a bit more.	game/level2.rpy	73	"[what]"
cameraroom_22273bc4		This is the Surveillance Room, where the cameras to most of the ship are located. Not all of the cameras are here, as the security team has their own camera room, but this one is often used to locate team members quickly.	game/level2.rpy	75	"[what]"
cameraroom_f86e35bf		Quinn takes a moment to breathe in air, something he felt like a scarce commodity while stuffed in the ventilation.	game/level2.rpy	77	"[what]"

cameraroom_62a51d7f		Quinn felt his heart stop for a moment, scared that he had just made a deadly mistake. He turned around to the source of that voice, only to find a wounded old man hiding beneath a desk.	game/level2.rpy	86	"[what]"
cameraroom_18840c13	q	Mr. Han?! What happened to you?!	game/level2.rpy	91	q "[what]"
cameraroom_abf5d79a		Mr.Han, one of the senior welders in the ship. His face was a mess, with bloody wounds all over it, some of them already colored black.	game/level2.rpy	93	"[what]"
cameraroom_ca445ab2	han	I... tried to find Ladeeva, I had already helped some other survivors get to the docks, but she wasn't there.	game/level2.rpy	95	han "[what]"
cameraroom_9b4fc4d0	han	Hoped... she was still alive, and I found her, but...	game/level2.rpy	97	han "[what]"
cameraroom_3241b411		Han blinks heavily a couple of times, and it's obvious he doesn't want to say the words.	game/level2.rpy	101	"[what]"
cameraroom_4ac41992	han	It was right in front of me... And they got me good when I ran to the ventilation, I won't... last much longer.	game/level2.rpy	103	han "[what]"
cameraroom_1c14dc25	q	Mr. Han, I-I can help you, here, let me just find something for the wounds-	game/level2.rpy	105	q "[what]"
cameraroom_20447d52	han	Don't fool yourself... Quinn, right? You seem like a good kid, don't waste your time pointlessly and just go.	game/level2.rpy	107	han "[what]"
cameraroom_d267661a	q	...	game/level2.rpy	109	q "[what]"
cameraroom_7370b1c5		Quinn didn't want to leave the old man to his fate, but he was right, those wounds were not the kind of stuff you treated on the go, this room was going to be his resting place.	game/level2.rpy	111	"[what]"
cameraroom_8a183724	q	I'm sorry...	game/level2.rpy	113	q "[what]"
cameraroom_4b2a04c0	han	Me too...just take this route, it will take you to the entrance of the docks, the others have sealed it so... you only need to call them out from the outside.	game/level2.rpy	115	han "[what]"
cameraroom_fc3d0e9c	q	Won't they suspect I'm like... the other ones?	game/level2.rpy	117	q "[what]"
cameraroom_8d319aab	han	No, if you speak... then you are good.	game/level2.rpy	119	han "[what]"
cameraroom_e2267786		Quinn wanted to ask his meaning but refrained himself from doing so.	game/level2.rpy	121	"[what]"
cameraroom_907a8f0f		He stepped right in front of the entrance to the next shaft, steeling his mind to the fact that not only he'd be leaving Mr. Han to die alone, but also that he had no other choice but to enter again one of those cramped spaces.	game/level2.rpy	123	"[what]"
cameraroom_154bd7c6		There was a screen with the cameras, perhaps he could use that to gain an idea of what he was facing?	game/level2.rpy	125	"[what]"
cameraroom_cd91fb4c		But he thought again, somehow it felt like if he did so, he would look at something he would regret	game/level2.rpy	131	"[what]"
cameraroom_eab8d6ef	q	Goodbye Mr. Han... thank you, and I'm sorry	game/level2.rpy	133	q "[what]"
cameraroom_e605b060		The old man laughed	game/level2.rpy	135	"[what]"
cameraroom_ebc69b20	han	Yes yes, go on, don't tell anyone about this, it will leave a sour taste.	game/level2.rpy	137	han "[what]"
cameraroom_16770622		Quinn smiled wryly, and entered the shaft.	game/level2.rpy	139	"[what]"
cameraroom_915cfe98		Quinn felt he needed to have at least an idea of the situation or he wouldn't be able to make it. What if he ran into another Alan?	game/level2.rpy	145	"[what]"
cameraroom_7222006e		He directed a brief look at the control panel which showed all the active cameras. More than half of them only showed a gruesome scenario, rooms full of blood and without any bodies to be seen.	game/level2.rpy	147	"[what]"
cameraroom_d505411a		But on one camera, he saw Alan, running like a madman, going from one area to another while limping from one leg, perhaps due to their encounter a few minutes ago.	game/level2.rpy	149	"[what]"
cameraroom_a4890318		And on another camera...	game/level2.rpy	151	"[what]"
cameraroom_1dbfd447	han	NO! Don't look at them!	game/level2.rpy	153	han "[what]"
cameraroom_c6dcf1c3		Quinn wanted to retort, but he found the words drowning in his own throat.	game/level2.rpy	155	"[what]"
cameraroom_e7cdaedd		The eye, once again, appeared inside of his own mind.	game/level2.rpy	167	"[what]"

cameraroom_a310ee36		Han clutched his chest mid-sentence, then gasped for air.	game/level2.rpy	175	"[what]"
cameraroom_c5af325f		Quinn got down to help him, but it was too late, the old man had passed away almost immediately, perhaps due to the stress of the moment.	game/level2.rpy	177	"[what]"
cameraroom_a274c578		He could not make sense of the words of Han, but he decided it would be best to heed them. Honoring his last words, Quinn went in the shaft without trying to look to the cameras again.	game/level2.rpy	179	"[what]"

cameraroom_18ec4549		This was an alien creature. Was this thing responsible of everything that was happening?	game/level2.rpy	195	"[what]"

living_quarters_6729e0e2		Even though it was an empty corridor, there was some debris on the floor, and the walls were covered in blood.	game/level2.rpy	271	"[what]"
living_quarters_3512f308		Normally, he would have checked out a bit more throughly, spent a few more moments to make sure there was no one around, but he was in a hurry to get out of that enclosed space.	game/level2.rpy	273	"[what]"
living_quarters_890e7960	q	Finally, an open space to breathe...	game/level2.rpy	277	q "[what]"
living_quarters_d1fb3892		He steps out of the shaft with little confidence, and looks around a bit more.	game/level2.rpy	279	"[what]"
living_quarters_c1571066		This is the living quarters, where most of the crew members sleep. It's a large area, with many rooms, and a few common areas.	game/level2.rpy	281	"[what]"
living_quarters_ffa9ccb8		The bad thing, the next shaft was on the other side of the corridor, and he would have to cross it to get there.	game/level2.rpy	283	"[what]"
living_quarters_22d994e8		He took a deep breath to calm himself down.	game/level2.rpy	285	"[what]"
living_quarters_812b3b72	q	I have to keep quiet...	game/level2.rpy	289	q "[what]"
living_quarters_83248d1c		Quinn knew he didn't have the luxury of time on his side, so he started moving forward.	game/level2.rpy	291	"[what]"
living_quarters_8aa68cf7		Each step was filled with an endless amount of fear, as he could see the bloody marks left everywhere in the corridor, in the floor, the walls, even the ceiling was full of them.	game/level2.rpy	293	"[what]"
living_quarters_a9cd5701		He worried about the cause behind all this carnage, what manner of creature would be able to do so much destruction in so little time.	game/level2.rpy	295	"[what]"
living_quarters_3c5e3763		As Quinn worried about such things, he found himself in the corner of the corridor. He had to turn left here to get to the shaft leading to the docks.	game/level2.rpy	297	"[what]"
living_quarters_dcdc70e0		He knew better than to just stroll there, so he kneeled and peeked carefully at the other side.	game/level2.rpy	299	"[what]"
living_quarters_1a3b3b9e		A small figure was standing right in the middle of the corridor. It looks like a child but there was no way to really be sure due to the darkness that enveloped the whole area.	game/level2.rpy	305	"[what]"
living_quarters_46e03938		The most worrying thing was that it was standing in front of the shaft's entrance.	game/level2.rpy	307	"[what]"
living_quarters_a2a21638		If Quinn was to do anything, he'd have to do it fast.	game/level2.rpy	309	"[what]"

living_quarters_ac2fca3e		The figure crashed near the entrance to the shaft, and its head hit the floor with a loud thud.	game/level2.rpy	319	"[what]"
living_quarters_d8b3a71b		Quinn looked at the face belonging to that figure, and he felt his heart stop for a moment.	game/level2.rpy	321	"[what]"
living_quarters_d11edee5		It was indeed a kid, no more than 10 years old, with a bloody face and a blank stare.	game/level2.rpy	323	"[what]"
living_quarters_b2271fe2		There weren't many kids in the ship, and Quinn knew most of them. This one was Alan's son, Ricky.	game/level2.rpy	325	"[what]"
living_quarters_e4b17bd4		Quinn felt sick to his stomach at the thought of possibly having killed a kid, but immediately after the thought entered his head, he felt shivers down his spine.	game/level2.rpy	327	"[what]"
living_quarters_7a60ecea		There were other similar shadowy figures standing in the corridor, and even though one could not see their eyes, Quinn knew they were all looking at him.	game/level2.rpy	329	"[what]"
living_quarters_2f0f13e9		He looked at Ricky again, and he saw that the eyes were not blank, they were looking at him, and they were full of hate and a bright color red.	game/level2.rpy	331	"[what]"
living_quarters_e7cdaedd		The eye, once again, appeared inside of his own mind.	game/level2.rpy	342	"[what]"
living_quarters_cab9e159		Quinn grabbed his head in pain, as if a screwdriver was being slowly pushed into it, but luckly it subsided faster than before.	game/level2.rpy	344	"[what]"
living_quarters_ad8cccc4		He hurried to enter the shaft, as he could hear the footsteps of the other figures approaching him.	game/level2.rpy	346	"[what]"
living_quarters_a717b625		He entered the shaft and closed the door behind him, and he could hear the figures banging on the door, trying to get in.	game/level2.rpy	348	"[what]"
living_quarters_9612eb80		But after a few seconds, the banging stopped, and everything went silent.	game/level2.rpy	350	"[what]"
living_quarters_cb7038e8		Quinn was tempted to peek through the slits in the door, but he remembered the words of the letter, and decided against it, continuing towards the docks.	game/level2.rpy	352	"[what]"
living_quarters_9280f6be_1		Quinn knew he had to act fast, so he decided to just go for it.	game/level2.rpy	358	"[what]"
living_quarters_6cb66b80		He kept to the shadows as much as possible, and avoided the direction of where it appeared that it was looking at.	game/level2.rpy	360	"[what]"
living_quarters_367d8918		He managed to get a few steps away from the entrance of the shaft, but then he heard a voice.	game/level2.rpy	362	"[what]"
living_quarters_796f63e0	"???"	Don't leave, come and see...	game/level2.rpy	364	"???" "[what]"
living_quarters_4f685313		Quinn's heart skipped a beat, and he turned around to see another figure standing right in front of him, followed by a sharp pain in his stomach.	game/level2.rpy	366	"[what]"
living_quarters_54ab2e30		A pair of scissors were sticking out of his stomach, and he could feel how the blood started dripping from the wound.	game/level2.rpy	368	"[what]"
living_quarters_fc6f0f11		He looked at the face belonging to that figure, and it was a kid. No more than 10 years old, with a bloody face and a blank stare.	game/level2.rpy	372	"[what]"
living_quarters_6faf09f2		His skin was pale and translucent, and his veins pulsed with a dark energy. His eyes were like two pools of blood, and his lips were curled into a cruel smile.	game/level2.rpy	374	"[what]"
living_quarters_dea64f29		He recognized the kid, Horace, the grandkid of Miss Ladeeva, and one of the few kids in the ship.	game/level2.rpy	376	"[what]"
living_quarters_c325b0e4		Quinn's survival instincts reacted, and he pushed Horace away from him with force, and ran towards the shaft.	game/level2.rpy	378	"[what]"
living_quarters_991415b4		The kid fell to the ground, and Quinn could hear him laughing as he entered the shaft.	game/level2.rpy	380	"[what]"

start_10a56e1e	l	It's so quiet and boring out here. Nothing ever happens on these space travels.	game/script.rpy	52	l "[what]"
start_418878c5	q	Well, that's a good thing, right? I mean, you don't want anything actually unexpected to happen in space.	game/script.rpy	54	q "[what]"
start_80135dad	l	Yeah yeah I know, It's just so boring out here, stuck doing the same repair work day in and day out.	game/script.rpy	56	l "[what]"
start_c6f84bc7	l	The only interesting thing to happen is when a meteorite hits the ship and we have to fix the hull, or a circuit overloads and we have to spend hours in those damn suits while we fix it.	game/script.rpy	58	l "[what]"
start_032c0d4d	q	Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm just glad we're not on a military ship. I hear they have to deal with pirates and stuff.	game/script.rpy	60	q "[what]"
start_7a9026ca	l	I think I would prefer it there. Here it's like we're on a never-ending loop. Fixing broken equipment, checking inventory, and all that jazz.	game/script.rpy	62	l "[what]"
start_73ec965d		The sound of the intense hammering from the other side of the cargo bay suddenly intensifies.	game/script.rpy	64	"[what]"
start_6d70cb20	alan	...	game/script.rpy	68	alan "[what]"
start_49f3e3ba	q	And what about that guy? He's been hammering away like a madman for hours now. What is it now, the 5th day in a row?	game/script.rpy	70	q "[what]"
start_a4423c17	l	Alan? Yeah, some of the guys are really worried about him, he's been acting strange for the past couple of weeks, and now with that hammering, he says he's fixing some loose plates but I don't know...But he's one of the seniors, he's been at this for like two decades.	game/script.rpy	72	l "[what]"
start_7d1a9bc3	l	Once they get to that point, they live in their own little world, tinkering away without a care, as if they are robots instead of humans.	game/script.rpy	76	l "[what]"
start_cb61a3a3	q	Might be the only way to stay sane out here. I mean, we're stuck in this tin can for months at a time.	game/script.rpy	78	q "[what]"
start_3c6c558a		Logan lets out a long sigh.	game/script.rpy	80	"[what]"
start_37e2d5c8	l	I always thought being a technician in space would be more adventurous.	game/script.rpy	82	l "[what]"
start_5523a472	q	Remember that time when the gravity control system malfunctioned? We were floating around like astral explorer minus the cool suits. You could count that as an adventure	game/script.rpy	84	q "[what]"
start_25a9042a		They both chuckle at the memory.	game/script.rpy	86	"[what]"
start_853ac2c6	l	Oh man, I thought we were going to be stuck up there forever.	game/script.rpy	88	l "[what]"
start_a6b4170a	q	Not everyone gets the chance to work in space, you know? I mean, we're technicians in space. That's pretty cool.	game/script.rpy	90	q "[what]"
start_c4f2fbed	l	Yeah, I guess you're right. I just wish we could do something more exciting.	game/script.rpy	92	l "[what]"
start_d30019c4	q	Well, we could always go to the bar and get shitfaced afterwards, you know, the ol'reliable solution to any and all problems in life.	game/script.rpy	94	q "[what]"
start_913ce4a6	l	Haha, yeah, I guess we could do that. I shouldn't complain too much. It's still a pretty cool gig when you think about it.	game/script.rpy	96	l "[what]"
start_32ca2d00	l	What do you say we head to the dining hall for some dinner? I'd hate to get drunk on an empty stomach again, last time I did that I woke up in the med bay.	game/script.rpy	98	l "[what]"
dininghall_d4011c04		The dining hall of the Stellaris is a large room compared to most of the common areas of the ship, but it is still quite small considering that almost two hundred people inhabit the vessel, and usually most of them converge in this very room at the same time.	game/script.rpy	113	"[what]"
dininghall_a080f8cc		The duo enter the dining hall and head towards the food counter.	game/script.rpy	115	"[what]"

dininghall_23230393	q	I do not know how you can eat that stuff, it's so bland.	game/script.rpy	129	q "[what]"
dininghall_1cae42fe	l	Meat is meat my friend, and as you said, I should not complain, we are in space after all.	game/script.rpy	131	l "[what]"
dininghall_e335c416	q	Ugh...	game/script.rpy	133	q "[what]"

dininghall_74828862	q	Fine, fine, guess I'll just swalow it down.	game/script.rpy	137	q "[what]"
dininghall_18a5d869	ladeeva	Attaboy!	game/script.rpy	139	ladeeva "[what]"
dininghall_4c1cb203		They both grab their trays and head towards the tables.	game/script.rpy	146	"[what]"
dininghall_39354484		The dining hall is full of people, which is quite common given the reduced size of the hall for the amount of people it holds, and the noise of the conversations and the clattering of the cutlery is almost deafening.	game/script.rpy	148	"[what]"
dininghall_4defccaf	q	Why did they have to enforce that you can't eat in your room? I can barely hear myself think in here.	game/script.rpy	152	q "[what]"
dininghall_0ef19d3f	l	You can't get rid of the roaches then, you know, they only need a bit of food and a small space to crawl into and then you have a full colony of them.	game/script.rpy	156	l "[what]"
dininghall_7f9384fb	q	Well, it does suck to find one of the flying ones in your bed.	game/script.rpy	158	q "[what]"
dininghall_2c778e42	q	Let's just eat fast then.	game/script.rpy	160	q "[what]"
dininghall_be89b388		They start eating, but then, there's a commotion on the far side of the hall.	game/script.rpy	162	"[what]"
dininghall_05415593	q	What's that?	game/script.rpy	164	q "[what]"
dininghall_b21610f8		They both look towards the commotion.	game/script.rpy	166	"[what]"
dininghall_6d70cb20	alan	...	game/script.rpy	172	alan "[what]"
dininghall_ef06bc84	yselle	What the hell is that?!	game/script.rpy	176	yselle "[what]"
dininghall_818bfaaf		Due to the amount of people in front of them, they are not able to see the reason for all the fuzz, but Quinn manages to get a glance at something.	game/script.rpy	178	"[what]"
dininghall_0c7fdb38		A red eye, sitting inside a ball of bloody flesh	game/script.rpy	186	"[what]"
dininghall_f229128d		Quinn's heart pounded in his chest as he stared at eye. He had seen many strange things in his time in space, but nothing like this. The eye was bloodshot and unblinking, its red iris staring up at him with an intelligence that was both alien and malevolent.	game/script.rpy	190	"[what]"
dininghall_e6ed4129		He took a step back unconciously and bumped into Logan, who was still trying to see what was going on.	game/script.rpy	192	"[what]"
dininghall_673dd00a	l	Hey, did you see what happened? What is it?	game/script.rpy	198	l "[what]"
dininghall_df5990fa		Quinn could not respond.	game/script.rpy	202	"[what]"
dininghall_f4b7c271		Even though the people in front of him had blocked his view of the ball of flesh, it was still vivid in his mind, and he felt...	game/script.rpy	204	"[what]"
dininghall_4257f1e1		He felt like he could still see the eye, and it looked directly at him	game/script.rpy	206	"[what]"
dininghall_4cbbed7e		Quinn felt a wave of nausea wash over him, as if his brain was being scrambled, trying to make sense of something that was beyond its comprehension. He knew he should turn away, but he couldn't, he could still see that eye even if he closed his own.	game/script.rpy	211	"[what]"
dininghall_c45f8330	l	Dude, are you ok? You are pale as a ghost.	game/script.rpy	213	l "[what]"
dininghall_1d3572a3		He could hear Logan's voice, but it sounded distant, as if he was underwater.	game/script.rpy	215	"[what]"

cargobay_08c4ab48		They keep working around Quinn's tasks for several minutes in where they actually manage to complete everything that Quinn needed to do	game/script.rpy	247	"[what]"
cargobay_f293739e	q	Ok, that's done, I'll have to brag to Yselle about this later.	game/script.rpy	251	q "[what]"
cargobay_50f787df	l	Ho? Are we that close now? I thought you were still trying to get her to go out with you.	game/script.rpy	255	l "[what]"
cargobay_4014611c	q	I haven't, we just enjoy talking to each other	game/script.rpy	257	q "[what]"
cargobay_dc2634f6	l	Aha, sure... You want to snuggle your supervisor, nothing wrong with that	game/script.rpy	259	l "[what]"
cargobay_0aed2d6a	q	Screw you, punk	game/script.rpy	261	q "[what]"

cargobay_c218d627		But suddenly...	game/script.rpy	265	"[what]"

cargobay_132bc1c7	q	I don't know... looks like screams, perhaps there was an accident in the kitchen, let's go there.	game/script.rpy	273	q "[what]"

cargobay_9e831a62		Alan looks completely unhinged, and his face looks like it was smeared with blood	game/script.rpy	281	"[what]"
cargobay_9adc8e5b	l	Did he go completely nuts from a moment ago?	game/script.rpy	285	l "[what]"

cargobay_f229128d		Quinn's heart pounded in his chest as he stared at eye. He had seen many strange things in his time in space, but nothing like this.

cargobay_204f3b6d		With all of that going through his head, Quinn is stunned, unable to move.	game/script.rpy	302	"[what]"
cargobay_d22c0928		Alan continues running and goes past them, but directs a very suspicious glance at Quinn before he turns his head forward.	game/script.rpy	304	"[what]"
cargobay_0dfe0987	l	What in the...looked like he was carrying something, but why such a rush? Did something happen back there?	game/script.rpy	306	l "[what]"

cargobay_df5990fa		Quinn could not respond.	game/script.rpy	310	"[what]"
cargobay_8de536f7		That thing... he only glanced at it for a mere instant, but in his mind...	game/script.rpy	312	"[what]"
cargobay_4257f1e1		He felt like he could still see the eye, and it looked directly at him	game/script.rpy	314	"[what]"
cargobay_4cbbed7e		Quinn felt a wave of nausea wash over him, as if his brain was being scrambled, trying to make sense of something that was beyond its comprehension. He knew he should turn away, but he couldn't, he could still see that eye even if he closed his own.	game/script.rpy	319	"[what]"

cargobayrun_9df81944		His footsteps are irregular, and his breathing is shallow.	game/script.rpy	350	"[what]"
cargobayrun_4f642400		Before he can leave the bay, a figure bumps into him.	game/script.rpy	352	"[what]"
